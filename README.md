Topical-Influence

=========================
## Overview
Social curation services are emerging social media
platforms that enable users to curate their contents according to
the topic and express their interests at the topic level by following
curated collections of other usersâ€™ contents rather than the users
themselves. The topic-level information revealed through this
new feature far exceeds what existing methods solicit from the
traditional social networking services, to greatly enhance the
quality of topic-sensitive influence modeling. In this paper, we
propose a novel model called the topical influence with social
curation (TISC) to find influential users from social curation
services. This model, formulated by the continuous conditional
random field, fully takes advantage of the explicitly available
topic-level information reflected in both contents and interactions.
In order to validate its merits, we comprehensively compare
TISC with state-of-the-art models using two real-world data
sets collected from Pinterest and Scoop.it. The results show that
TISC achieves higher accuracy by up to around 80% and finds
more convincing results in case studies than the other models.
Moreover, we develop a distributed learning algorithm on Spark
and demonstrate its excellent scalability on a cluster of 48 cores.
